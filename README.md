# Automated-Pill-Dispenser
The main objective for this system is to mitigate the probability of patients skipping and forgetting to take their medications on time. 
It will be accomplished by having a device that is keeping track of real time. 
When the device registers the alarm time is approaching, It will have an alarm system to notify the user the time to take the medication is near. 
It will then dispense when the time has been reached. 
There are many ways to accomplish such task but with the use of trade-off analysis, we will be able to identify the most cost effective, efficient and reliable system.

The system will include two major modules, electrictronics and mechanical. 
The electronics will be an Arduino Uno microcontroller to control an LCD screen for the clock, time set features, and DC motor. 
We will run tests to see what mechanical system will be the best for our system of interest.
